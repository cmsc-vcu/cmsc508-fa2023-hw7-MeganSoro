- This repository holds my solution for homework 7.

# Overview
## This repository holds a qmd file for homework 7, which was rendered into an html file to display the work. The qmd file contains many different tasks. Additionally, there is an sql file that was used to create the tables and how the tables relate to each other with primary and foreign keys. 
### hw7-ddl.sql creates 
- a skills table
- a people table 
- a roles table 
- a peopleskills table 
- a people roles table 
### Additionally it populates each of the tables with entries
### The qmd file has 
- a description of the project 
- a crows foot diagram 
- examples of data in the database 
- the skills table displayed 
- the people table displayed 
- the roles table displayed 
- sample queries




In order to use the project, displaying the rendered html file in a localhost is required.
The database can be seen from phpMyAdmin
